django-signup
=============

django-signup is a quick, simple user registration app. No bells. No
whistles. Just enter an email address, click on the activation link in the
resulting email, then enter a username and password. It works, but it's very
probably poorly written. Feel free to improve it and make it more robust.

To use django-signup, do the following:-

1. Run 'python setup.py install' and add 'signup' to your project's
   INSTALLED_APPS setting.

2. Add SIGNUP_EXPIRY_DAYS to your project's settings file.

3. Run 'python manage.py syncdb' in your project root directory.

4. Add the following line to your root URLConf:-
    (r'^signup/', include('signup.urls')),

5. Create a folder called 'signup' in your templates directory, and create
   the following templates:-

    'signup_form.html' - form for just an email address
    'check_mail.html' - page asking for user to check their email
    'activate_form.html' - form asking for username and password (once)
    'key_invalid.html' - page stating activation key is invalid
    'signup_successful.html' - page stating signup process successful
    'activation_email.txt' - The email body containing the activation key
    'activation_email_subject.txt' - The email subject line

6. That's it!

You only enter a password once, as I hate having to enter it twice. If you
mess it up, you'll have to do a password reset.
